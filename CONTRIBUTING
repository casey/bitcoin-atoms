# Table of Contents

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

- [Reporting Errors/Issues](#issues)
- [Contributing Code/Documentation](#code)
- [Translating](#translations)

## Code

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository and
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork.

2. Before you start coding, consider opening an
   [issue at Github](https://github.com/casey/ord/issues) to discuss the
   suitability and implementation of your intended contribution with the ord development community.

   You may also benefit from discussing on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ordinals). 
   or our [Github Discussion Board](https://github.com/casey/ord/discussions)

3. Start coding!
    - Refer to the
      [Contributor Documentation](https://docs.ordinals.com/contributing.html)
    - Follow the [Rust Code Style](.github/workflows/ci.yaml) code-style/linting.
    - Check your code works, has relevant/effective testing, and resolves/mitigates the targeted error.

4. Commit & [push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) your changes to a new branch (not `master`)
    - Commit messages should:
        - Avoid opinionated language
        - Be descriptive. See the commit messages by core developers for examples.

5. Once you are happy with your changes, submit a pull request.
     - Open the [pull-request form](https://github.com/casey/ord/pull/new/master).
     - Add a description explaining what you've done and/or what is left to be done.

### A pull-request may be considered for merging when:

1. It works.
2. It follows the code style/linting for [Rust](.github/workflows/ci.yaml).
3. The code's interfaces is well-designed and extensive/conducive to further development
4. It uses libraries and patterns which include/expose the required compatibility.

## Issues

If you experience an issue, we would like to know the details.

1. Do a quick search on GitHub to check if the issue has already been reported.
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/new) and describe
   the issue you are having - you could include:
     - Error logs and Screenshots
     - Ways you have tried to solve the issue, and whether they worked or not
     - Your platform (e.g. Windows 10 or Ubuntu 15.04 x64)

After reporting, you should continue to participate in discussion to help identify the root cause for timely resolution.
