Digital Artifacts
=================

Imagine a physical artifact. A rare coin, say, held safe for untold years in
the dark, secret clutch of a Viking hoard, now dug from the earth by your
grasping hands.

It has an owner. You. As long as you keep it safe, nobody can take it from you.

It is complete. It has no missing parts. It is a complete object.

It is unique. There may be other coins, but not exactly like yours.

It can only be changed by you. If you were a trader, and you made your way to
18th century China, none but you could stamp it with your chop-mark.

It can only be disposed of by you. The sale, trade, or gift is yours to make,
to whomever you wish.

What are digital artifacts? Simply put, they are the digital equivalent of
physical artifacts. Digital things, but very much like that coin of yours.

For a digital object to be a digital artifact, it must be:

Owned
Complete
Unique

Independent
Permissionless
Transferrable
Uncensorable


immutable
unseizable
permissionlessly

transferable
uncensorable
