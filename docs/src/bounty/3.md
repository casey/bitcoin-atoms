================

Criteria
--------

Ordinal bounty 3 has two parts.

The bounty is open for submissions until block 764064â€”the first block of
difficulty adjustment period 379. Submissions included in block 764064 or later
will not be considered.

Both use [frequency.tsv](frequency.tsv), a list of words and the number of
times they occur in the [Google Books Ngram
dataset](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html).
filtered to only include the names of ordinals which will have been mined by
the end of the submission period, that appear at least 5000 times in the
corpus.

`frequency.tsv` is a file of tab-separated values. The first column is the
word, and the second is the number of times it appears in the corpus. The
entries are sorted from least-frequently occurring to most-frequently occuring.

`frequency.tsv` was compiled using [this
program](https://github.com/casey/onegrams).
